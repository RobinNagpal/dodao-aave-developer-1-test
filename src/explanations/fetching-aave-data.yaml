    AAVE is a DeFi protocol that facilitates the lending and borrowing of
    cryptocurrency tokens using diverse algorithms and smart contracts without
    centralized intermediaries. 

    It is a non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to participate as
    lenders or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a
    passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized
    manner.

    Aave's GraphQL data layer is a great resource for developers, allowing
    developers to access data that may not have been available otherwise. This
    way developers can work with more data and create more advanced
    applications. 

    Just like any decentralized blockchain application, Aave's data can be
    classified into three types: 

    - **Real-time data or current information** - This includes the current
    state and the new events. With real-time data, you can use data
    visualisations that reflect changes as they occur in real-time. This means
    that dashboards are interactive and accurate at any given moment.

    - **Historical** - This includes past state and events. With historical
    data, you can get a snapshot of information displayed in a chart.


    As discussed above, there are multiple use cases of this data provided by
    Aave and varied applications (including read-only as well as read/write
    applications) can be built on top of it and we can examine this data to gain
    insights on how to update and continue to improve the application.


    The focus of this chapter will be to use Aave's data and show it on the UI
    in a couple of use cases. 

    - Creating a pie graph to review the aave treasury in USDT 

    - Implementing a time series graph of how the holdings of different pools
    have changed over time.


    Before moving on to the code, let's have a look at the importance of
    analytics.


    **Importance of Analytics**

    - Make informed decisions

    - Improve efficiency

    - Identify frauds

    - Improve protocol governance

    - Accelerate through uncertainty

    - Tackle bugs and problems

    - Transform raw data into more valuable information


    Aave's data can be queried in the form of REST or GraphQL. Aave uses “The
    Graph” to index its data and anyone can query the subgraphs to get access to
    this information.

    #### The Graph and GraphQL

    The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from
    Ethereum-based blockchains. That is, obtaining specific data from the
    blockchain is a more convenient approach while adhering to the web3 ethos
    and benefiting from decentralization and stability.


    The underlying query language used in The Graph is GraphQL. What is the
    distinction between RESTFUL API calls and GraphQL calls? Traditional APIs,
    on the other hand, require developers to define unique endpoints for users
    that return specified data. If the user requires further information, they
    may need to make repeated API calls, potentially hundreds of API calls, to
    obtain it. As long as the developer has established a flexible schema, The
    Graph (which uses GraphQL) just requires one call to a subgraph.

    See this [GraphQL
    primer](https://medium.com/graphprotocol/graphql-will-power-the-decentralized-web-d7443a69c69a)
    for additional information on The Graph and the underlying GraphQL.


    #### Source of Aave Subgraphs

    To view the source of the subgraphs, see our [Github
    repo](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2-subgraph).


    Production Network:
    [Polygon](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/aave/protocol-v3-polygon)


    #### How to Make Use of the Playground


    - If you use your browser to navigate to the above playground links, you
    will be directed to The Graph's playground, where you can simply write and
    test GraphQL queries.

    - Select the purple play button to run your query.

    - In the middle column, the query results will be returned.

    - Use the 'Schema' column on the right to see what data is available, which
    may be investigated to discover the underlying data.

    - You can also type in the left column and use the auto-complete feature to
    identify the appropriate query/types.


    #### Points to keep in mind

    - All address values (for example, when used for id) must be in lowercase.

    - In lowercase, the ID of reserves is the asset's address and the address of
    the market's LendingPoolAddressProvider.

    - When utilizing the raw endpoints, the numeric number queried will be
    returned in either wei units (i.e. 10^18), the decimals of the asset itself
    (i.e. 10^6 for USDC), or ray units (i.e. 10^27).

    - By default, each 'page' of results returns 100 entries. This is expandable
    to a maximum of 1000 entries per page.

    - To list the following 1000 entries, for example, put something like:
    (skip:1000, first: 1000) to your query's arguments.

    - This is also true for nested entries, such as arrays.


    This Graph endpoint contains only static data. To obtain a user's most
    recent balance (including interest earned up to that moment), you must
    either compute it yourself or make a balanceOf() call to the aToken
    contract.

    completely open-source, naturally. It was born in September 2018 during
    ETHBerlin and has been growing in contributors ever since.


    #### Using your app to access GraphQL data


    The preferred method is to utilize a client library that can handle the
    'plumbing' to ensure you have up-to-date data (with caching sometimes
    included). Apollo is used internally, but there are several choices
    depending on your programming language; read the official GraphQL page for
    more information.

    If you are unable to utilize a client library (for example, while querying
    using Postman), you can send a POST request to our subgraph's HTTP endpoint
    with the header: "Content-Type: application/json" and the body comprising of
    your query on one line in quotations. As an example:

    ```

    {"query": "{ reserves (where: {usageAsCollateralEnabled: true})  { id name
    price {id} liquidityRate variableBorrowRate stableBorrowRate}}" }

    ```

    Now we will use the [Aave Protocol API](https://aave-api-v2.aave.com/) to
    create a time series graph.

    We will use the same react application to create the time series graph too,
    so if you still haven't create a react app by following the previous steps.


    Since the the [Aave Protocol API](https://aave-api-v2.aave.com/) is for v2
    mainnet so now we need to query the Aave v2 mainnet subgraph.


    We need to make the fetch requests from
    https://aave-api-v2.aave.com/#/data/get_data_rates_history to get the time
    series data for any Aave reserve. 

    If you visit the above link, you can see that we require a reserveID to
    fetch the data (there is a sample reserveID already provided in case you
    want to try it out). So to get this reserveID, we will query the Aave v2
    mainnet subgraph
    (https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/aave/protocol-v2 ). We have
    already queried the reserveIDs for ChainLink Token
    (0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca0xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5)
    and TrueUSD
    (0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b3760xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5)
    which we will be using to plot the graph. 


    If you want to query the reserveID yourself, you can try this:

    ```graphql

    {
      pools {
        reserves {
          id
          name
          symbol
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    This query returns us an array of objects which contains the pools with the
    reserves id, name and symbol.


    Also, in the GET request we need to provide the start date (from) and time
    interval (resolutionInHours) to fetch the data. You can use
    [this](https://www.epochconverter.com/) UNIX timestamp convertor to change
    the date.

    So now you can visit the aave protocol api and playaround with different
    reserveID, from and resolutionInHours.


    Now, let's visit our App.js and add some changes to code to get our desired
    graph.


    * Let's add some import statements as we need to use Line Chart this time to
    represent the time series data. So you can update your import statements to
    the following:
      ```javascript
      import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react';
      import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';
      import { Chart as ChartJS, ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend, CategoryScale, LinearScale, PointElement, LineElement, Title, } from 'chart.js';

      import { Pie, Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';
      import './App.css';

      ChartJS.register(ArcElement, 
          CategoryScale,
          LinearScale,
          PointElement,
          LineElement,
          Title,
          Tooltip,
          Legend
      );
      ```

    * Now, we need to fetch the get requests so for that we will use the
    useEffect hook from React and store the data using useState hook. So add the
    following code to your DisplayGraphs functions:
      ```javascript
      const [linedata1, setLinedata1] = useState([]);
          const [linedata2, setLinedata2] = useState([]);

          useEffect(() => {
              Promise.all([
                  fetch('https://aave-api-v2.aave.com/data/rates-history?reserveId=0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca0xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5&from=1667952000&resolutionInHours=6'),
                  fetch('https://aave-api-v2.aave.com/data/rates-history?reserveId=0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b3760xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5&from=1667952000&resolutionInHours=6'),
              ])
              .then(([resData1, resData2]) => 
                  Promise.all([resData1.json(), resData2.json()])
              )
              .then(([data1, data2]) => {
                  console.log(data1, data2);
                  setLinedata1(data1);
                  setLinedata2(data2);
              })
              .catch(([err1, err2]) => {
                  console.log(err1.message, err2.message);
              });
          }, []);
      ```

      The Get request also returns some unwanted data and the timestamp is in a format which we don't like much, so let's update it:
      ```javascript
      let timestamps = linedata1.map(a => (a.x.year + '/' + a.x.month + '/' + a.x.date + ' ' + a.x.hours + ' hours'));
          let utilization1 = linedata1.map(a => a.utilizationRate_avg);
          let utilization2 = linedata2.map(a => a.utilizationRate_avg);

          timestamps.forEach((element, index) => {
              timestamps[index] = element.toString();
          });
      ```
    * Now, let's create the Line chart using the following code:
      ```javascript
      const optionsLineChart = {
              responsive: true,
              plugins: {
                legend: {
                  position: 'top',
                },
                title: {
                  display: true,
                  text: 'Avg Utilization Rate',
                },
              },
          };
            
      const linedata = {
          labels: timestamps,
          datasets: [
            {
              label: 'ChainLink Token',
              data: utilization1,
              borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
              backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)',
            },
            {
              label: 'TrueUSD',
              data: utilization2,
              borderColor: 'rgb(53, 162, 235)',
              backgroundColor: 'rgba(53, 162, 235, 0.5)',
            },
          ],
      };

      return (
          <div className="Chart-container">
              <div className="Pie-container">
                  <Pie options={optionsPieChart} data={piedata} />
              </div>
              <div className="Line-container">
                  <Line options={optionsLineChart} data={linedata} />
              </div> 
          </div>
      );
      ```

    This will provide us with the following time series graph:

- key: graphql-queries
  title: Graphql Queries
  shortTitle: Graphql Queries
  details: >-

    #### Examples of Queries


    We'll be using the mainnet Big uints GraphQL endpoints in the queries below.
    These queries can be copied and pasted into the Graph playground links.


    ##### Reserve Data

    If we want to receive a list of all the reserves that can be used as
    collateral, as well as the interest rates for each reserve, we can use the
    following query:

    ```graphql

    {
      reserves (where: {
        usageAsCollateralEnabled: true
      }) {
        id
        name
        price {
          id
        }
        liquidityRate
        variableBorrowRate
        stableBorrowRate
      }
    }

    ```


    We would utilise the reserves ERC20 token address to retrieve data for a
    certain reserve. For the Chainlink reserve, for example:


    ```graphql

    {
      reserve(id: "0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca0x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8") { // LINK
        symbol
        price
        aToken {
          id
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    If we wish to retrieve historical interest rate data for a specific reserve
    and paginate through the records, our query may look like this:

    ```graphql

    {
      reserve (id: "0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b3760x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8") { // TUSD
        id
        paramsHistory(skip:1000, first: 1000) {
          id
          variableBorrowRate
          utilizationRate
          liquidityRate
          timestamp
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ##### User Data

    When an address communicates with the Aave Protocol, a UserReserve is
    generated, with the user ID equal to the user's address plus the reserve's
    ID (which is the ERC20 token address).

    To obtain information on a certain UserReserve:

    ```graphql

    {
      userReserve(id: "USER_ADDRESS_AND_RESERVE_ADDRESS") {
        reserve {
          id
          symbol
        }
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    To retrieve all reserves (i.e. positions) held by a specific user (notice
    that the user address must be lower case):

    ```graphql

    {
      userReserves(where: { user: "USER_ADDRESS"}) {
        id
        reserve{
          id
          symbol
        }
        user {
          id
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    ##### Deposit data

    To obtain recent deposits for a certain asset:

    ```graphql

    {
      deposits (orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { 
        reserve: "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec70x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8" // USDT
      }) {
        id
        amount
        timestamp
      }
    }

    ```


    ##### Borrow data

    To obtain recent borrows for a certain asset:

    ```graphql

    {
      borrows (orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc, where: { 
        reserve: "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec70x24a42fd28c976a61df5d00d0599c34c4f90748c8" // USDT
      }) {
        id
        amount
        timestamp
      }
    }

    ```


    ##### Flash loan data

    For instance, consider the following query for analysing the five most
    recent Flash Loans:

    ```graphql

    { 
      flashLoans( 
        first: 5 
        orderBy: timestamp 
        orderDirection: desc 
      ) { 
        id 
        reserve { 
          id 
          name 
          symbol 
        } 
        amount 
        totalFee 
        timestamp 
      } 
    } 

    ```
- key: react-app
  title: Querying Aave's GraphQL database using React and implementing a Pie chart
  shortTitle: React App
  details: |
    * **Initial Setup**
      First, let's create a React project, you can refer [this](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) documentation.
      ```
      npx create-react-app aave-analytics-sample-app
      ```
      Run npm start to check if the project runs fine.

    * **Integrate ApolloClient**
      Let's integrate the Apollo client library. We can install and setup the client using [this](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/) documentation.
      ```shell
      npm install @apollo/client graphql
      ```
      We can use the sample code to fetch the data and test our setup.

    * **Initialize the ApolloClient**
      With our dependencies already set up, we can now create an ApolloClient instance.
      Let's start by importing the symbols we require from @apollo/client into index.js:
      ```javascript
      import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider, gql } from '@apollo/client';
      ```
      Next, we'll initialize ApolloClient by handing it a configuration object including the uri and cache fields:
      ```javascript
      const client = new ApolloClient({
        uri: 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/aave/protocol-v3-goerli',
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
      });
      ```

    * **Connect the client to React**
      We can connect Apollo Client to React with the ApolloProvider component. Similar to React's Context.Provider, ApolloProvider wraps our React app and places Apollo Client on the context, enabling us to access it from anywhere in our component tree.

      In index.js, let's wrap our React app with an ApolloProvider
      ```javascript
      import React from 'react';
      import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
      import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';
      import App from './App';

      const client = new ApolloClient({
        uri: 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/aave/protocol-v3-goerli',
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
      });

      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

      root.render(
        <ApolloProvider client={client}>
          <App />
        </ApolloProvider>,
      );
      ```

    * **Fetching data with useQuery**
      After the ApolloProvider is hooked up, we can start requesting data with useQuery. The useQuery hook is a React hook that shares GraphQL data with your UI.
      Switching over to our App.js file, we'll start by replacing our existing file contents with the code snippet below:
      ```javascript
      import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

      export default function App() {
      return (
          <div className="App">
              <h2 className="App-header">AAVE Analytics</h2>
              <br/>
              <DisplayGraphs />
          </div>
      );
      }
      ```
      We can define the query we want to execute by wrapping it in the gql template literal:
      ```graphql
      const GET_QUERY = gql`
      {
          reserves {
              id
              symbol
              name
        
              totalLiquidity
          }
      }
      `;
      ```
      Next, let's define a component named DisplayGraphs that executes our GET_QUERY query with the useQuery hook:
      ```javascript
      function DisplayLocations() {
        const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_QUERY);

        if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

        let names = data.reserves.map(a => a.name);
          let total = data.reserves.map(a => a.totalLiquidity);
          let utilization = data.reserves.map(a => a.utilizationRate);

          total.forEach((element, index) => {
              total[index] = element % 10^18;
          });
      ….
      }
      ```

    * **Implementing the Pie Chart**
      Now, our aim is to create a pie chart using the data we receive. So now we'll use [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/).
      ```
      npm install --save chart.js react-chartjs-2
      ```
      Then we will import it in our App.js:
      ```
      import { Pie } from 'react-chartjs-2';
      ```
      Now we need to initialize our code to get a Pie chart:
      ```
      ChartJS.register(ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend);
      ```

    * Finally we will add the code to get our Pie chart:
      ```javascript
      const piedata = {
              labels: names,
              datasets: [
                {
                  label: 'percentage',
                  data: total,
                  backgroundColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 140, 64, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(205, 159, 64, 0.2)',
                  ],
                  borderColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)',
                    'rgba(205, 159, 64, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 149, 64, 1)',
                  ],
                  borderWidth: 1,
                },
              ],
          };

      const optionsPieChart = {
              responsive: true,
              plugins: {
                legend: {
                  position: 'top',
                },
                title: {
                  display: true,
                  text: 'Total Liquidity',
                },
              },
          };

        return (
              <div className="Chart-container">
                  <div className="Pie-container">
                      <Pie options={optionsPieChart} data={piedata} />
                  </div>
              </div>
          );
      ```

      This will give us a Pie chart in our React app.
