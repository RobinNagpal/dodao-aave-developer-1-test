  hint: NoHint
  explanation: >-
    Liquidation Threshold is the amount of a borrow position that must be
    liquidated because it is undercollateralized. When a collateral has an 80%
    liquidation threshold, it signifies that the loan will be liquidated when
    the debt value equals 80% of the collateral value. The liquidation threshold
    is defined in percentage points and is specified per collateral.
