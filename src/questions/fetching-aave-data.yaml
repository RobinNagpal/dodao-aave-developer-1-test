  hint: NoHint
  explanation: RESTFUL APIs require developers to define unique endpoints for users that return specified data. If the user requires further information, they may need to make repeated API calls, potentially hundreds of API calls, to obtain it. As long as the developer has established a flexible schema, The Graph (which uses GraphQL) just requires one call to a subgraph.

  content: Pick the correct statement(s) about the Aave's GraphQL queries.
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: All address values (for example, when used for id) must be in lowercase. In lowercase, the ID of reserves is the asset's address and the address of the market's LendingPoolAddressProvider. When utilizing the raw endpoints, the numeric number queried will be returned in either wei units (i.e. 10^18), the decimals of the asset itself (i.e. 10^6 for USDC), or ray units (i.e. 10^27).
